# Qi3353

Currently, the sources to discover on-campus events are either limited or inefficient. The primary way to discover events for Virginia Tech students is GobblerConnect, however many students find it a hassle to use and some are also unaware of the site itself. This motivated us to create a mobile Android application, Qi3353 (pronounced: cheese), that offers students a platform where they can find on-campus events with ease. The app acts as a central place for users to look for details about a particular event, such as its time and location, the organizationâ€™s name, and any other information about the event. We accomplish this by aggregating organizational events from other sources and display them on one centralized platform.
